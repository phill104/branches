**********************************************/

	This plugin will add an AJAX reCaptcha to pages configured with 
	Coppermine captcha in config.
	
	It is an update/mashup of SaWey's (Sander Weyens) cpg 1.5.x reCaptcha
	plugin with elements of Joe Carver's 1.4.x reCaptcha plugin. The reCaptcha
	is not loaded and shown on the page until the vistor clicks a button. It will
	require that the user have javascript in their browser. The plugin has a config.
	option to use the javascript reCaptcha on the contact page so that a vistor has a 
	noscript option to use the Contact form.
	
	Config. options also include setting the reCaptcha language (for the help and 
	tool-tips) and to set the style/color of the reCaptcha display.
	
	
	+++++++++++
	
	To Install:
	1) Upload and install via plugin manager.
	
	2) Enter your reCaptcha keys on the installation form. If you do not have the 
	keys click the link on the installation form - you will be directed to reCaptcha.net
	with your Coppermine's  url already in reference. Sign up for keys (it is free and 
	will take less than a minute) and return to enter your keys. Click Go and you are 
	done. 
	IT IS RECOMMENDED TO USE COPY AND PASTE TO ENTER YOUR KEYS
	
	3) You must set the values in Config. for Coppermine captcha (comment, registration,
	contact) for this plugin to function.
	
	4) Use the plugin configuration to customize to your needs.
